Clone the repository

Start up as a regular Spring Boot project

This app is using Spring Boot 3 with Java 17 (you need to have it installed)

For database it is right now using in-memory H2 so you don't need any additional setup

Instructions for using the different endpoints provided can be found at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html after start up

I would recommend first creating a user at /user which will provide you his ID that can be later used for manipulating his transactions

Spring Security is still not implemented
